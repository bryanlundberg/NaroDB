- Fast by default — Uses a compact binary format for efficient storage and retrieval.
- Simple to use — Offers a minimal and intuitive API with no need for complex setup or schema definitions.
- Lightweight — Designed to have a small footprint with minimal dependencies.
- Flexible — Suitable for storing a wide range of data structures and works well in embedded or serverless environments.
